using the video games data from kaggle to  see if DL can preidct the  sales number

Data from:

https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings

Im trying to use NN to predict the world sales number of video games.

After train the model the regression plot is like:

Model predict the testing data
